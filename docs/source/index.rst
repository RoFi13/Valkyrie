   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to Valkyrie's documentation!

Summary
-------

Valkyrie is a personal **Maya/Unreal Pipeline** I started to develop. The purpose for
this set of tools is to optimize working with assets inside Maya in a simple and easy
to understand way. I'm making these tools publicly available to help people with saving
time by automating the tedious things like saving your files with a specific naming
convention, versioning up files, putting quick playblasts in specific folders, etc.

A **primary goal** of the pipeline is to standardize naming conventions, folder
hierarchies, and some basic I/O of CG assets between Maya and Unreal Engine. I realize
that everyone has their own way of naming files and this pipeline is built to help
with allowing you to adjust it as you need.

.. ATTENTION::
   This is still a WIP pipeline and I am in the process of adding more tools.

Thanks for checking out the Pipeline and tools. I hope you enjoy using them!

Next Steps
----------

Below you will find next steps to understanding the pipeline and how to set it up for
your project.

I recommend reading the :doc:`general_documentation/project_overview` next.
